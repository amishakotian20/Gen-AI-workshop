Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

Types of AI:
1. Narrow AI – Designed for specific tasks (e.g., chatbots, recommendation systems).
2. General AI – Capable of performing any intellectual task like a human.
3. Super AI – Hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence.

Key Applications of AI:
- Healthcare (disease prediction, medical imaging)
- Finance (fraud detection)
- Autonomous vehicles
- Natural Language Processing
- Robotics

AI techniques include Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Expert Systems, and Computer Vision.
