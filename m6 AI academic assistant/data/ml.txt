Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning – Uses labeled data (e.g., regression, classification).
2. Unsupervised Learning – Finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering).
3. Reinforcement Learning – Learns through rewards and penalties.

Common Algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- K-Means Clustering
- Support Vector Machines

ML workflow includes data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
